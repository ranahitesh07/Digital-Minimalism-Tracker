## 🧠 Why I Made This

I was spending a lot of time online and wanted to be more mindful of it.  
So I made this app to log how long I use apps like YouTube, Chrome, etc. every day — manually.  
Yes, manually — because typing it makes me more aware than background tracking.

## 🔥 Live Demo

👉 [Launch the Web App](https://digital-minimalism-tracker-alt.streamlit.app/)

## ✨ Features

- 📆 Daily browser app usage tracking
- 📊 Bar chart visualization for each day
- 💾 CSV export for individual day
- 🧹 Option to clear/reset today's data
- 🔐 Local-first – no cloud data storage
